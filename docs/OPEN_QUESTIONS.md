# OPEN_QUESTIONS.md

Track and resolve before coding beyond Phase 1. If any item blocks progress, pause and ask.

1. **Initial Inventory**: Provide real starting lists (spirits families + subpools, mixers, additives, secondary pools). (Owner to supply.)
2. **Glassware Mapping**: Do we want explicit glass types by method (e.g., coupe for shaken sours) in Phase 1?
3. **Density Hints**: Provide approximate density ordering for common items; otherwise rely on simple syrup → cream → liqueur → spirit default.
4. **Max Counts**: Default upper bounds for #Spirits/#Mixers/#Additives (d6 style). Current assumption: 1–3 spirits, 0–4 mixers, 0–2 additives.
5. **Theme Accents**: Pick final accent colors (neon tokens) and whether to include subtle glow.
6. **Share Code Size**: Cap for hash length? (SVG includes textual ingredients; hash can stay <2KB.)
7. **Ratings Timing**: Ratings UI is Phase 2; confirm schema (1–5, optional note).
